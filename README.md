## Data Transformation and Loading 
Using Microsoft Excel, i did a comprehensive cleaning of the data which means that i made sure that it was neat and ready to be analyzed. I dealt with the inconsistency with the data type, checked for any missing values and made replacements where necessary. All of this was done to make sure that the data was ready for visualizations. 

## Data Analysis and Visualization
With the data in Microsoft Excel, i made some analysis to find interesting patterns and also created visual charts to show some of these patterns clearly. 
These visuals helped understand indicators like which region performed with the highest number of sales and also the region with the highest average profit, the sub-category that had the highest sales. 
I made use of the slicer to compare the region performance and also yearly performance.
